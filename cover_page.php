<b>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</b><br><br>
OCD is one such psychological disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reocurring thoughts called obsessions and behaviours referred to as compulsions that he or she feels the need to perform repeatedly numerous times. Efforts are being made to understand the issue of symptom specificity in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) through more recent and advanced studies in assessing different symptom patterns that may be related to age, ethnicity or gender. This chronic disabling condition affects around 1-3% of general population and approximately 1–2% of children, who are around 10–14 years of age.
