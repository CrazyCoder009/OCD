# OCD
Obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder in which a person feels the need to perform certain routines repeatedly (called "compulsions"), or has certain thoughts repeatedly (called "obsessions"). The person is unable to control either the thoughts or activities for more than a short period of time. 

## Purpose of the project:
To identify and understand the root cause and nature of this disorder this is a simple PHP/HTML based web app portal designed to predict the occurance of the disorder in patients based on simple Q/A with the capability of sharing medical reports universally between doctors and patients.
